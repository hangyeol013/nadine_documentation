## Nadine Project Documentation

This site documents the main layers of the Nadine social robot system and is aimed at new developers joining the project.

- **Perception layer**: camera input, face detection and recognition, 3D tracking, and selective visual memory.
- **Interaction layer**: dialogue, memory, and reasoning components.
- **Control layer**: low-level robot control, animations, and hardware integration.

Each layer page explains:

- **What the layer does and how it fits in the overall system**
- **How to run it end-to-end**
- **Important modules, their responsibilities, and how they interact**
- **Key configuration options and typical extension points**
